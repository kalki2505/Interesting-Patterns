# Interesting-Patterns
A collection of interesting patterns formed using for-loops and basic logic in C.
 
Here are come examples of the patterns that I have included here.
Example 1:
1 
2 3
4 5 6
Example 2:
* * * *
* * * 
* *
*
Example 3:
* * * * *
  * * *
    *
  
User-interface with the console:

1. Enter the number of rows you want to see of the patter.
Note that this is a very basic implemantion of for-loops and hence try to enter only a positive integer value.

2. And that's it! Look at the amazing pattern after this.
